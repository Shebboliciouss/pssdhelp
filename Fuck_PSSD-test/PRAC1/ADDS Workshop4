Email would a linked list because its current time how recent the message is at the top both cases it would be a O(1) Array O(N) have to reallocate the memory as yuo cant predict size of the total email 
array is one continuous big block memory, link list is small block of memory

chat application is linked list we r not loading the whole history of chat only a small snippet but array loads everything but link list can

todo list is dynamic array normally ordered can index it and can acces the middle elements easily but it would be not efficient as you needto reallocate memory to add another task 
Linked list--> 50 things you need to see the whole list rather than a small snippit about it
