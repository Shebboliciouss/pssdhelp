Paternity Test 

Initial thoughts: 

The problem is about comparing the DNA sample from the child, mother and the 
several men's DNA to find the potential father of the child. The criteria is that
half of the child's DNA must match the mother's DNA and the remaining half of 
the child's DNA must match one of the the mens' DNA.Rhe indices of the mens 
who meet that criteria are then returned.

I could tackle this problem by firstly initialising a vector to store the indices
of the possible fathers and a variable to keep track of the last chracter index.


Next, I will use a nested for loop. The outer for loop(i) will iterate through
the elements in the mens vector to get the string and then initialise a variable
that stores the amount of same chracters in the child string and the mens string
Then, there will be another for loop(j) that iterates through the child's 
string length. inside the loop,  an if else statement is utilised that checks
whether the child's character in the DNA matches with the 
corresponsing chracter in the men's DNA and if that statement is true then the
variable that storesthe amount of same chracters between child and men's DNA
characters will be increased by 1. Else if the child's DNA character does not 
match to the corresponding character in the mother's DNA then it will break the
inner loop. Before the inner loop ends, the variable that tracks the last 
chracter index will get updated to the corresponsing 'j' value, then only 
loop(j) will end.

 Afterwards, there will be a variable that stores the 
the length of half of the child's DNA string. Before the loop(i) ends, there 
will be an if statement that checks whether if the amount of same chracters 
between child and men's DNA is more than or equal to the half of the child's DNA
and if the variable that keeps track of last chracter index inreased by 1, is equal to
the length of the child's DNA, that would mean that it has iterate through the end of child's DNA
and the child's DNA matches with the mom and possible dad's DNA. 
When both statements are true then the men's index will
get added into the vector that I initialised at the beginning.

After the nested for loop ended, the vector that stores
the indices of the possible fathers is returned.

Reflection:

This problem was quite straightforward.The solution was quite apparent and I had good practice on problems
involving strings. In turn I need more practice on numbers 
that involves recursion and dynamic programming.

Overall Reflection: 

Overall, the Christmas Tree problem was the hardest for me to wrap around my head around as I did not realised
 that it was a problem involving maths.This led me to realize that I need to practice more questions that implement more mathematical formulas
so i do not get stuck again.
