Initial thought: 
The problem was quite straight forward . I needed to identify occurences
of 'A' and 'Z' in the string and reverse their order which will then form a 
decrypted spell. I could tackle this problem by using a for loop to find the 
the letters of 'A' and 'Z' and append those letter accordingly into another 
string variable. Then, I could use another for loop that iterates through each 
character of the string again and replace the characters which are 'A' and 'Z'
based on the reverse order of the previous string variable found. 

Reflection : 
The problem was quite simple and straightforward to understand. It refreshes
my memory on string manipulation and it drives me to think the importance of 
simplicity in my algorithm so that there's less prone to errors.


Overall Reflection:

Throughout these problems, I have once again practiced my problem mapping skills and 
segregating a problem into step by step increments which lead to easier understanding of
the problem itself. Moreover, I have also practised implementing more recursive functions
in to solving these conplex problems. These in turn would deem useful in future as it 
would I'd have more ways to approach different problems. One thing I would need to 
improve on is better optimisation of code as well as implementing more than on solution to my
code in order to practise more aspects of my skillset which in this case dynamic programming.
